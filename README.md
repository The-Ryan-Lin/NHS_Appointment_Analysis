<h2>Assignment Overview</h2> 
  <p>
The goal of this project was to explore NHS appointment data within primary care and determine what can be done to reduce and eliminate missed appointments by investigating two main areas of capacity and resource utilisation in the NHS.

Four datasets were used in this analysis and can be found in the repository. The first three datasets contain primary care appointment data in the NHS and the last dataset is health-related tweets scraped from Twitter.

It is estimated the each missed appointment costs the NHS an average £30 per person, which may not seem like a lot but adds up to over £290 millions wasted in just half a year from people not attending their appointments and It is estimated that in the second half of 2022 5% of all appointments were missed.
