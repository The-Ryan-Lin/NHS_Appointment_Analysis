## NHS - Appointments in General Practice

The goal of this project was to explore NHS appointment data within primary care and determine what can be done to reduce and eliminate missed appointments by investigating two main areas of capacity and resource utilisation in the NHS.

## Four datasets were used in this analysis and can be found in the repository. The first three datasets contain primary care appointment data in the NHS and the last dataset is health-related tweets scraped from Twitter.  
1. actual_duration.csv
2. appointments_regional.csv
3. national_categories.csv
4. Tweets.csv

## The working order of how this project was approached is shown below and corresponds to chapters seen in the Jupyter Notebook.
1. Setting Up the GitHub Repository
2. Importing and Exploring Data
3. Analysing the Data: Initial Exploration
4. Sentiment Analysis: NHS-related Twitter Data
5. Visualising and Identifying Initial Trends
6. Findings and Recommendations
